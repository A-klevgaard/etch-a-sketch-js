Simple js program that will load a webpage with a grid of cells for the user to interacte with. 

Mousing over a grid cell will affect it in 3 different ways depending on which mode the user has selected.
"Black" will simple turn cells on or off (white/black)
"Dimmer" will turn a cell greyscale, and make it 10% darker
"Random Color" as it's name implies, will fill the cell with a random color.

The user is also able to create a new grid of up to 100 cells in side length if they so choose.
